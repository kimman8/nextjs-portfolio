Hi! My name is Kim and I enjoy creating art, code and weird projects for this perfect and always evolving medium: the web! My interest in web development started back in 2006 when I decided to try editing custom MySpace profiles — turns out hacking together a custom button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
Fast-forward to today, and I've had the priviledge of working as a mechanical engineer and project manager serving the mining, recycling and manufacturing industries and designing machinery for some of Australia's largest mining corporations. However, deep down I knew my passion was in the web and so my main focus these days is building accessible, human-centered products and digital experiences at AKQA for a variety of clients such as Officeworks, BMW, Nissan and Australian Super.
JavaScript is my love language. Here are a few technologies I've been working with lately: React, NextJS, TypeScript, GraphQL, HTML & CSS.
